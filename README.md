# Health Insurance Cost Prediction

This repository contains a project focused on predicting health insurance costs based on various individual attributes. The project leverages data preprocessing, visualization, and machine learning techniques to analyze and model the relationship between features and insurance charges.

## Project Overview

The main goal of this project is to predict health insurance charges using features such as age, sex, BMI, smoking habits, and region. This analysis helps understand key factors influencing insurance costs and provides a foundation for building predictive models.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes the following columns:
- `age`: Age of the individual
- `sex`: Gender of the individual (`male` or `female`)
- `bmi`: Body mass index (a measure of body fat based on height and weight)
- `children`: Number of children/dependents covered by the insurance
- `smoker`: Smoking status (`yes` or `no`)
- `region`: Residential region (`northeast`, `northwest`, `southeast`, `southwest`)
- `charges`: Medical insurance costs (target variable)

## Key Features

### Data Analysis and Visualization
- Summary statistics of the dataset
- Visualizations of distributions and relationships between features

### Data Preprocessing
- Handling missing values (if any)
- Encoding categorical variables
- Splitting features and target variable for modeling

### Machine Learning
- Linear regression for predicting insurance charges
